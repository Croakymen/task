###### i vow to do the thing
# i will write stuff

# been listening to a lot of the doors lately
# really want to create a sort of work inspired by the desert imagery, in twine or inform7 format
# a wild west text adventure perhaps
# following on from the assignment one case studies, a big topic is pacing.
# i think speeding the game up for a gun duel could be really smart use of medium.
# working at aldi and having to type in product codes extremely fast is reminiscent of typing literacy software
# text inputs would deal damage according to the number of characters
# type 'shoot' instead of 'fan' for accuracy

# travel the wilds learning new and powerful verbs
# the meanest vaquero in the wasteland has a WPM of 121

#21/3/23:
# i quite like the idea if using onomatopoeia as the dialogue options
# makes things very visual and is reminiscent of the long tradition of wild west comics

# 27/3/23: 
# twine seems to be very useful software to create piece inside of
#image formatting seems a little difficult however
#I was interested in using images a lot so i might take a cue from dwarf fortress and use text graphics
#there is probably a site online to convert .SVG to text graphics or something

#17/4/23
#bitsy is a good candidate to employ ludic aspects within a work
#whether it is possible to combine with twine text is yet to be seen
#it could have some issues in terms of loading times
#it could habe some issues with multiple branches since all twine code is on a single page

#might need to do traditional html links for options in order to have multiple bitsy files for each choice
#isometric bitsy graphics maybe

#21/4/23
#as task two approaches it becomes more and more apparent that bitsy is too rigid in its aesthetic sensibility.
#Currently, it seems a twine using GIFs is the best choice. They seem to load ok thus far.

#24/4/23
#I have mocked up a draft map for the presentation, which is a small fishing village.
#Though demonstration of GIF in twine went well proving concept, I must now focus on organising story
#I think this fishing village may prove to be too isolated for a dynamic story to take place in

#26/4/23
#Been looking at a lot of photography journals of Pablo Lopez Luz, and his series on hotels and resorts.
#Might keep the missing shoes story, change the setting to luxury resort
#This is my strong suit as making procedural music on latin themes is easy
#Inspired by the Caetano Veloso song 'superbacana'

#3/5/23
#It is becoming apparent that Harlowe is disappointingly inflexible in its image formatting
#I seem unable to use an image as a selectable option
#I may just be bad with code
#If I had more time, I would have been very interested in sugarcube story format, as it seems to give more freedom

#12/5/23
#GIF content of story transitions just fine.
#Netlify supports sites up to 100gb.
#I will upload final GIFs in 4k to use this.

#14/5/23
#Struggling to get harlowe variables to work. I am so unused to writing code, even in the harlowe markup language. Lots of syntax errors.
#Despite this, story takes shape well.
#Luxury resort setting works well for facilitating mystery narrative with a focus on exploration.

#17/5/23
#Though I proposed four endings, each with unique graphics, this is looking less likely.
#This is simply due to the direction the story is heading, where changes to the overall scene may not be noticed.
#Instead, I would consider unique GIFs for each passage, perhaps at a lower filesize.

#20/5/23
#Even a simple story like this has an incredible amount of depth to it that is not apparent upon a playthrough/reading.
#It seems the story threads converge toward a single confrontation with hotel staff. Though this is not listed in the proposal, I am willing to embrace it.

#21/5/23
#The difference between the possible end product and the proposal is something I am not overly concerned with. 
#The proposal was largely techically-oriented, going over the possibility of using GIFs with twine.
#As such, story based changes are not of too much concern.

#24/5/23
#Struggling to implement text boxes that adhere to the stylesheet. A highlighted input box goes a dark colour that harms the presentation of the piece.
#The styling of text and the background is the same as the GIF, colour-picked hex value.
#Though I have spent some time preparing text boxes, if I am to choose between cohesive presentation and added functionality, I will choose presentation

#26/5/23
#Struggling to change stylesheet on variable cues. Not sure how this is possible without javascript. 
#Nothing on this is listed in harlowe manual.
#Changes to day/night cycle or scenery fall out of sync with background and text colour. 
#Ugly result.

#28/5/23
#Implementation of simple sound effects building procedural soundtrack based on variables is possible, but unlikely
#Getting every passage to run a secret 4 second timer to keep music on track will be incredibly difficult.
#Though it was in my proposal, I will not be able to execute it in the final project without more time.

#29/5/23
#I am no longer working on GIFs. I suspect only the basic one will be used due to being unable to edit stylesheet in passage.

31/5/23
#Work is looking very polished... Though not without a number of missing features.
#I am not sure whether my twine is complicated or just poorly organised.

1/6/23
#My girlfriend broke up with me

2/6/23
#Its going to be very close...
