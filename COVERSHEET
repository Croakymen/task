- 'Superbacana' is a branching narrative told in the second person, as the player searches for their missing shoes in an immense hotel. It runs off of 21 variables over the course of 102 passages. As the story develops, the labyrinthine and disorienting nature of hotels come to mirror the reality of interactive fiction's ability to create complex iterations on a simple premise. It features three plotlines that all converge on a single ending.
